# Exemplary Zigbee2MQTT and Node-RED setup

In this section, we will demonstrate a exemplary setup for [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/) and [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-8.html) using Docker.
For more detailed documentation on how to set up these components, we recommend the linked documentation.

> **Note**: If you already have a working Zigbee2MQTT, MQTT-Broker, and Node-RED installation, you can skip this section.


## Prerequisites
You have a Linux machine with Docker installed.
We tested this on:
- An Intel NUC running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
- A Raspberry PI 2 and 4 running Raspian / Raspberry Pi OS.

And you have a supported Zigbee adapter for Zigbee2MQTT.
See [Zigbee2MQTT Docs: What do I need?](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/what_do_i_need.html).
If you have a bit of money to spend, we suggest the [Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-CC1352P-2 Zigbee adapter](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html#texas-instruments-launchxl-cc1352p-2) because the range is better and supports way more devices.


## Setup Process

1. **Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed.**
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~$ docker --version
    Docker version 19.03.13, build 4484c46d9d

    andreas@nuc:~$ docker-compose --version
    docker-compose version 1.27.4, build 40524192
    ```

2. **Plugin the Zigbee Adapter into your device.**
    
    It should appear as a device in `/dev`. Most of the time, the location is `/dev/ttyACM0`. See [Zigbee2MQTT docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/running_zigbee2mqtt.html#1-determine-location-of-cc2531-usb-sniffer-and-checking-user-permissions). 

    To look for the adapter in `/dev` run:
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~$ ls -d /dev/*ACM*
    /dev/ttyACM0
    ```
    
    If it is any different from `/dev/ttyACM0`, you have to update the device in the `docker-compose.yml` file to grant Zigbee2MQTT access to the adapter. We will create the `docker-compose.yml` in the **next step** - remember it for now.
    ``` yml
    services:
      zigbee2mqtt:
        devices:
          - device=/dev/ttyACM0
    ```

3. **Configuring the Docker containers**

    In this step, we will create three Docker containers using Docker compose.
    For simplicity, we will map the volumes to a folder in the user's home directory.

    We will create three containers.
    - Mosquitto MQTT Broker
    - Zigbee2MQTT (Connects to Mosquitto)
    - Node-RED (Connects to Mosquitto)

    For general understanding: Node-RED does not directly connect to Zigbee2MQTT. Only via the Mosquitto broker as a middleware.

    Let's create some directories first.
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~$ mkdir ~/smarthome
    andreas@nuc:~$ cd ~/smarthome/
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ mkdir nodered
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ mkdir mosquitto
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ mkdir mosquitto/config
    ```

    Now create the docker-compose file with the editor of your choice.
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ nano docker-compose.yml
    ```

    The [compose file](docker-compose.yml) contains our three containers (Node-RED, Zigbee2MQTT, and Mosquitto).
    You can copy and paste this configuration. Remember to adjust the Zigbee adapter if you are using a different adapter than `/dev/ttyACM0`.

    ``` yml
    version: "3.8"

    services:
      zigbee2mqtt:
        image: koenkk/zigbee2mqtt:latest
        container_name: z2m_composed
        volumes:
          - /run/udev:/run/udev:ro
          - ${PWD}/z2m:/app/data
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
        environment:
          - TZ=Europe/Berlin
        devices:
          - device=/dev/ttyACM0
        network_mode: "host"
        restart: always
        privileged: true
        depends_on:
          - mosquitto

      mosquitto:
          image: eclipse-mosquitto
          container_name: mosquitto_composed
          volumes:
            - ${PWD}/mosquitto:/mosquitto
          ports:
            - "1883:1883"
            - "9001:9001"
          restart: always

      nodered:
          image: nodered/node-red
          container_name: nodered_composed
          volumes:
            - ${PWD}/nodered:/data
          ports:
            - "1880:1880"
          restart: always
          depends_on:
            - zigbee2mqtt
            - mosquitto
    ```

    Before we run our containers, we also have to configure Mosquitto.
    Create the following config using your favorite editor:

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ nano mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
    ```

    Paste this configuration to define the logging and persistence locations, the port to listen to on any interface. Furthermore, this enables anonymous authentication to keep this tutorial simple. Mosquitto provides multiple [authentication methods](https://mosquitto.org/documentation/authentication-methods/) for production systems.

    ```    
    persistence true
    persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
    log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
    listener 1883
    allow_anonymous true
    ```

4. **Create and run the Docker containers**

    Now we can run our containers for the first time. Docker will pull all the images, and the containers will create their default configurations and initialize.

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ docker-compose up
    ```

    Have a look at the output. If you can't see any errors, you should be good to go.
    After the containers are initialized, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to stop the containers.

5. **Configure PAN ID and Zigbee channel**

    After your containers have been stopped, open the Zigbee2MQTT configuration.

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ sudo nano z2m/configuration.yaml
    ```

    It should look like this:

    ``` yml
    # Home Assistant integration (MQTT discovery)
    homeassistant: false

    # allow new devices to join
    permit_join: true

    # MQTT settings
    mqtt:
      # MQTT base topic for zigbee2mqtt MQTT messages
      base_topic: zigbee2mqtt
      # MQTT server URL
      server: 'mqtt://localhost'
      # MQTT server authentication, uncomment if required:
      # user: my_user
      # password: my_password

    # Serial settings
    serial:
      # Location of CC2531 USB sniffer
      port: /dev/ttyACM0
    ```

    At the end of the configuration, we add the advanced section. It defines a custom PAN ID and a channel. This is a best practice because if a neighbor suddenly uses the same default PAN ID, re-pairing all the devices would be necessary.
    For more settings, check out the [Zigbee2MQTT configuration docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/configuration.html).
    Also, enable the [frontend](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/frontend.html) and the experimental API so that we can see rename our devices.

    ``` yml
    advanced:
      # Optional: ZigBee pan ID
      pan_id: 815
      # Optional: ZigBee channel, changing requires re-pairing of all devices.
      # (Note: use a ZLL channel: 11, 15, 20, or 25 to avoid Problems)
      # (default: 11)
      channel: 15
    frontend:
      port: 8080
    experimental:
      new_api: true
    ```

6. **Run your containers in the background**

    You now configured all the basic settings. You are now ready to run the containers in the background. To do so, supply the `--detach` switch to the docker-compose command. See [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/).

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ docker-compose up --detach
    ```

    If you want to stop the detached containers later to change the settings, you can run `docker-compose down`.


7. **Check everything is running** 

    Open `http://ip-of-your-device:8080/` in your browser to view the Zigbee2MQTT frontend.

    Open `http://ip-of-your-device:1880/` in your browser.
    If an empty Node-RED dashboard loads, I'd like to congratulate you - you finished the Node-RED setup.

8. **Install the Zigbee2MQTT Nodes for Node-RED**

    Open the the Palettte: `Menu` > `Manage palette` > `Install tab`

    Search for `node-red-contrib-zigbee2mqtt-devices` and install it.

    ![Install node-red-contrib-zigbee2mqtt-devices](img/getting-started-install-palette.png)



## After setup considerations

This setup is very basic. We suggest a few things that should be done but would be too much for this tutorial's scope. Have a look at the [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/) and [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-8.html) documentation on how to configure them.


**Authentication**

Right now, Mosquitto and the Node-RED interface do not use any authentication. We advise you to set up authentication.

**Secure connection**
With the default configuration, the MQTT connection and the HTTP connection to the Node-RED web interface are not encrypted. Mosquitto can be configured with TLS and Node-RED with HTTPS.

**Disable paring mode**
Currently, Zigbee2MQTT is configured to [let new devices join](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/pairing_devices.html).
After you have added all your devices and are done with the initial setup, you should disable this by setting `permit_join: false` in the `z2m/configuration.yaml`.




# Pairing our devices with Zigbee2MQTT
Now it's time to [pair](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/pairing_devices.html) some devices.

For my demonstration, I use the following devices and pair them.

- [Philips Hue white ambiance E27 bulb (9290022169)](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/9290022169.html)

    ![Philips Hue white ambiance E27 bulb (9290022169)](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/images/devices/9290022169.jpg)

- [TRADFRI LED bulb, dimmable, warm white (LED1836G9)](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/LED1836G9.html)

    ![TRADFRI LED bulb E26/E27 806 lumen, dimmable, warm white](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/images/devices/LED1836G9.jpg)

 Each device is a bit different to pair, so check the [Zigbee2MQTT Supported Devices docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_devices.html) or your manufacturer's documentation on how to pair or reset devices. A switch, for example, requires me to press the pair button four times, the (brand new) bulb I just have to plug in.

After you pair your devices, you should see them in the Zigbee2MQTT frontend.
For better distinction between the devices is advisable to rename your devices.

![Zigbee2MQTT frontend with renamed devices](img/getting-started-z2m-renamed.png)




# Define your first flow

Now that we get everything set up, we can start to define our first flow. Let's begin to switch the lamp from software first.


1. **Pull the *send messages* node into the flow.**
    
    Since this is our first node, we have to configure how to connect to the Zigbee2MQTT bridge. Click on the little edit icon to define a new bridge.

    ![generic lamp node](img/getting-started-flow01-send-messages.png)

    To define the bridge, we enter a name, stick with the default MQTT topic, and configure a broker via the edit icon.

    ![bridge config](img/getting-started-flow02-bridge-config.png)

    We can then configure the Mosquitto server as our broker. I had to use the device IP and not localhost to get it working. Since authentication is not configured, I left it blank.

    ![bridge config](img/getting-started-flow03-mqtt-config.png)
    
    **Important**: Before we continue, we have to **deploy** the flow once, so the configured Zigbee2MQTT bridge is available to all the nodes. If everything worked out, we should see a little green connected indicator.

    ![connected](img/getting-started-flow04-connected.png)

2. **Add the *generic lamp* node**

    Add the *generic lamp* node, connect it's output to the *send messages* node.
    Next, define a new *device config* for your lamp via the little edit icon.
    
    ![generic lamp](img/getting-started-flow05-generic-lamp.png)

    Give the light a name, select a Zigbee2MQTT device you paired, and define its capabilities.
    In our case, it is dimmable, can change the color temperature but has no RGB color support.

    ![generic lamp](img/getting-started-flow06-hue-device-config.png)

    Back in the *generic-lamp* config, we can define to set the brightness to `30` (range from 0 to 255).
    And the color to `153` (around 6500° Kelvin). The color uses the Mirek scale, with values usually between 50 and 400.
    
    `Mirek = 1.000.000 / Temp. in Kelvin`

    More on that in [Zigbee2MQTT Set topic](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/mqtt_topics_and_message_structure.html#zigbee2mqttfriendly_nameset) or on [Wikipedia Mired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mired).

    ![Change color and brightness](img/getting-started-flow07-brightness-color-hue.png)

3. **Inject a message to trigger the lamp change**

    Drag a *inject* node into your flow and connect it to the *generic lamp* node (no particular setting needed). Now you can deploy the changes.

    If you now click on the button next to the *inject* node, you should see your light turn darker and cold white!

    ![Flow with added inject node](img/getting-started-flow08-inject-node.png)


    **So, how does this work?**

    The Z2M nodes always append the information that shall be sent to the current message of the flow.
    The *send messages* node then interprets the changes to be made and publishes them via MQTT.
    In this case, we only have one lamp, and we defined the values directly within the *generic lamp* node.

    After the *inject* node, you start with just a random message object. For our use-case this does not really matter.
    ``` json
    {
      "_msgid":"b0db48e0.9cf638",
      "payload":1606336827099,
      "topic":""
    }
    ```

    After the *generic lamp* node, the message object now contains one device in the payload, with the settings specified.
    ``` json
    {
        "_msgid":"b0db48e0.9cf638",
        "payload":{
            "devices":[
                {
                    "topic":"Phillips Hue white ambience",
                    "state":"ON",
                    "delay":0,
                    "target":"z2m",
                    "brightness":"30",
                    "transition":"2",
                    "temperature":"153"
                }
            ]
        },
        "topic":""
    }
    ```

    As mentioned, the send message interprets that payload and generates and sends the MQTT messages.

    At this point, you are probably asking yourself: Why this has to be so complicated. Why can the *generic lamp* node not directly send the message to Zigbee2MQTT?

    The thing is, usually, we don't only want to switch one lamp - we want to switch multiple lamps.
    With the current implementation, we would add one *generic lamp* to turn our lamp on and one *generic lamp* to turn it off. This can quickly escalate.
    Because of this reason, we will later introduce *override nodes*. Override nodes allow you to set values for multiple devices. We will come back to that later after we added a few more devices.

    > **For now, you shall note that the *generic lamp* node does two things:**
    > 1. Adds the lamp as a device to the payload so it will be triggered by send messages.
    > 2. Adjusts values for individual devices.
 

4. **Toggle the Lamp**

    We got a lamp that we can turn on. Let's continue by also let us turn the lamp off.
    The simplest form to do that is to tell the lamp to toggle*. If we send a Toggle command to the lamp, the lamp itself decides to turn on or off based on its current state. The toggle is not implemented in Software in Zigbee2MQTT, but rather by the Lamp itself. So it can vary from lamp to lamp. The Phillips HUE Bulb, for example, always switches between 0% and the brightness that was last configured. It does not consider the set brightness in that case.

    To get the lamp to toggle, we open *generic lamp* node config and change the state form `On` to `Toggle` and **deploy** the changes.
    
    ![State: Toggle generic lamp config](img/getting-started-flow09-toggle-device-config.png)
    
    If we now click the inject button multiple times, the lamp should turn off and on again. You can also see that the lamp indicator now turns off and on again.

    ![Toggeling generic lamp node](img/getting-started-flow10-toggle.gif)


5. **On / Off**

    Toggling can be fine if you use a button. But if you use a switch, then you usually want to turn them off with dedicated buttons.

    So let's add another *inject* node and rename the two *inject* nodes to `On` and `Off`. They will represent our switch.

    ![On button](img/getting-started-flow12-on-off-flow-1.png) 

    Then change the state of the *generic lamp* to `ON`.

    ![Set the State to ON](img/getting-started-flow07-brightness-color-hue.png)

    We are now back where we started, and the lamp only turns on.
    Let's now duplicate the *generic lamp* node wire it to the *off inject* node and the *send messages* node.

    ![On off buttons](img/getting-started-flow12-on-off-flow-2.png) 

    Then we configure the second *generic lamp* node state to `OFF`

    ![Set the State to OFF](img/getting-started-flow11-off-device-config.png)

    If we deploy the changes, we can turn the lamp on and off.

    ![Toggeling the lamp](img/getting-started-flow13-on-off-flow-3.gif)
    
    > **Example flow** [One lamp On/Off](../examples/getting-started/one-lamp-on-off.json) is included in the package.
    > 
    > Import it via: `Node-RED Menu > Import > Examples > node-red-contrib-zigbee2mqtt-devices > getting-started > one-lamp-on-off`

6. **More lamps**
    Let's add another lamp and first illustrate how we would implement the lamp with the knowledge from the previous step. Add a new *generic lamp* node and define a new device config in the lamp. In my case, I configured an Ikea Trådfri blub that is warm white but dimmable. Set the State to On and the brightness to 255.
    Connect it to the *on inject* on and the *send message* node. Then duplicate the *generic lamp* node and just change the state to `OFF` and connect it to the *off inject* node and to the *send messages* node.

    Now the two lamps are wired up in parallel and can be switched on/off with the same *inject* node.

    ![Lamps in parallel](img/getting-started-flow14-second-lamp-paralell.png)

    If you have a lot of lamps, this can get a bit messy. Let's clean that up a bit by connecting the lamps in series.

    ![Lamps in parallel](img/getting-started-flow15-second-lamp-series.png)


    Message object after the first *generic lamp*.
    ``` json
    {
        "_msgid":"b0db48e0.9cf638",
        "payload":{
            "devices":[
                {
                    "topic":"Phillips Hue white ambience",
                    "state":"ON",
                    "delay":0,
                    "target":"z2m",
                    "brightness":"30",
                    "transition":"2",
                    "temperature":"153"
                }
            ]
        },
        "topic":""
    }
    ```

    Message object after the second *generic lamp*.

    ``` json
    {
        "_msgid": "b0db48e0.9cf638",
        "payload": {
            "devices": [
                {
                    "topic": "Phillips Hue white ambience",
                    "state": "ON",
                    "delay": 0,
                    "target": "z2m",
                    "brightness": "30",
                    "transition": "2",
                    "temperature": "153"
                },
                {
                    "topic": "Ikea Trådfri 806lm",
                    "state": "ON",
                    "delay": 0,
                    "target": "z2m",
                    "brightness": "254",
                    "transition": "2"
                }
            ]
        },
        "topic": ""
    }
    ```

    As you can see, the two devices are now in the same payload. The send messages will take both devices and send individual messages to Z2M via MQTT.

7. **Override nodes**

    Configuring the settings in the single lamp node is simple and easy
    if you have one lamp or want to set specific settings per lamp.
    If you want to control values for a group of lamps instead, we created *override* nodes.
    *Override* nodes set (override) the values for all the lamps in the message.
    So if you want to sitch a group of devices, you can apply to all the lamps in the message.
    
    Let's remove the duplicate *generic-lamp* nodes that were connected to the off switch. And add two *override-state* nodes after the *On* and *Off* switches. Configure the *override-state* nodes by setting one to `ON` and the other to `OFF`.

    ![Override nodes](img/getting-started-flow16-override-nodes.gif)

    
    What happens behind the scenes is that the message payload, now contains an override section and the two lamps. The *send messages* node gets this message object and interprets it. From the message, it knows it has tow devices to trigger, and it uses the values from the override section and applys them to all the devices. Meaning it overwrites the state of both devices and sets it to `OFF` before sending it.

    ``` json
    {
        "_msgid": "bcc6e6d9.13e8a8",
        "payload": {
            "override": {
                "state": "OFF"
            },
            "devices": [
                {
                    "topic": "Phillips Hue white ambience",

    ```

    This also gives us the possibility to add multiple overrides at once. E.g., for color or brightness.
    Let's create a relaxed mode where we dim the brightness with an *override-brightness* node (set to `127`) and set the color to warm white with the *override-temperature* node (set to `333`).
    
    ![override color and temperature](img/getting-started-flow17-override-multiple.gif)

    The three override values are applied to both devices, but only in case the *relax mode* inject node was pressed. Normal *On* and *Off* uses the default color and temperature set in the *generic-lamp* nodes.

    {

        "payload": {
            "override": {
                "brightness": "127",
                "temperature": 333,
                "state": "ON"
            },
            "devices": [
                {
                    "topic": "Phillips Hue white ambience",
                    "state": "ON",
                    "delay": 0,
                    "target": "z2m",
                    "brightness": "30",
                    "transition": "2",
                    "temperature": "153"
                },
                {
                    "topic": "Ikea Trådfri 806lm",
                    "state": "ON",
                    "delay": 0,
                    "target": "z2m",
                    "brightness": "254",
                    "transition": "2"
                }
            ]

    Overrides are a powerful tool and probably the most useful when they are connected to remotes and switches.
    In general, we advise you to work more with *override* nodes instead of setting the values in the *generic-lamp* itself. A layout with more lamps could look like the following example.

8. **Set override JSON manually**

    Since the *override* nodes simply add JSON to the payload, we can use that to create some debug buttons.
    Let's add a new *inject* node called work mode and set the payload to this JSON.
    ``` json
    {"override":{"brightness":"255","temperature":100,"state":"ON"}}
    ```
    
    ![inject override](img/getting-started-flow18-inject-override.png)

    If we now connect the *work mode* node to the *generic lamp* nodes, we can see the override working similarly as in the relax mode.

    ``` json
    {
        "_msgid": "897c244.c1d08d8",
        "payload": {
            "override": {
                "brightness": "255",
                "temperature": 100,
                "state": "ON"
            },
            "devices": [
                {
                    "topic": "Phillips Hue white ambience",
                    "state": "ON",
                    "delay": 0,
                    "target": "z2m",
                    "brightness": "30",
                    "transition": "2",
                    "temperature": "153"
                },
                {
                    "topic": "Ikea Trådfri 806lm",
                    "state": "ON",
                    "delay": 0,
                    "target": "z2m",
                    "brightness": "254",
                    "transition": "2"
                }
            ]
        },
        "topic": ""
    }
    ```

9. **Final thoughts**
    
    The general idea with all these nodes is that they modify the message in the payload and then send the changes via the *send messages* node to the MQTT broker. All the decisions on which exact MQTT messages to send are made by the *send messages* node.

    What to do next? Maybe replace the inject nodes with a switch, add some colored lamps. Be creative 😊.
