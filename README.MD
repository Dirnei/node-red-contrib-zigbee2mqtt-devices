This project contains Node-RED nodes that allow you to build Smart Home scenarios with your Zigbee devices connected to [ZigBee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/).

- [ota-node](docs/nodes/ota-node.md)
- [bridge-log](docs/nodes/bridge-log.md)
- And many more for sensors and remotes...

## Getting started

Have a look at [the getting started guide.](docs/getting-started.md). All you need are some already paired Zigbee lamps and an installed Node-RED. What are you waiting for? Find out now how easy it is to get started.

## Changelog 

### Release: `0.19.6` _13 Nov 2022_

#### Features:

#### Bug fixes:
- Bridge did not connect in newer z2m versions because z2m changed the format of 'bridge/state' from string to JSON.
- Shelly 2.5 did not connect to the broker, because it used an old configuration node.
- Shelly 2.5 node did not unsubscribe from the old channel with no full redeploy.

#### Behind the scenes
- Add mocha and first-unit test examples
- Add integration tests to test with a real MQTT broker

### Release: `0.19.5` - _14 Mar 2022_

#### Bug fixes:

- Hosting the Node-RED UI under a different root path than `http://localhost:1880/` resulted in failing web requests to load the device list. For example, when the UI was set to `http://localhost:1880/admin` or Node-RED was running as a Home Assistant plugin.
- Fixed a bug where the configured device name gets deleted, when the device list couldn't be loaded. Further details in #105 and #119

### Release: `0.19.4` - _01 Jan 2022_

Happy new year to all!

#### Bug fixes:
- @itupsk fixed the issue #114, where we forgot a null check on the ikea bugfix in the last release. Thanks a lot!
- Also fixed the same issue in hue, scenic and sonoff devices

### Release: `0.19.3` - _30 Dec 2021_

#### Features:
- Documented additional settings for upgrading to mosquitto 2.0 in the getting started guide.
- Documented Mirek scale. 

#### Bug fixes:
- Not set property on Ikea Remote device caused a complete Node-Red restart
- Not set property on Hue Remote device caused a complete Node-Red restart
- Preventive measure: Check action for empty string in scenic remote and sonnoff buttons

### Release: `0.19.2` - 12 Mar 2021

#### Bug fixes:

- Local node-red installation with nodejs 12 had a problem to load the node-red dependency. Removed it for now as it is only used for logging.

### Release: `0.19.1` - 8 Mar 2021

#### Bug fixes:

- Better handling for invalid MQTT messages from z2m. Sometimes a required/expected property is missing or empty which caused an error.
- Hue Dimmer switch crashed NodeRED because the power status with no action came with no action.

#### Behind the scenes

- Removed some unnecessary files from the package, reducing the size from 324 kB to 229 kB
- Removed vulnerable dependencies
- Updated and thinned out dependencies so the installation will be faster
- Dev feature: Cleaned up npm build scripts so there are no warnings, and they behave the same on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Release: `0.19.0` - 23 Jan 2021

#### Features:
- Two new example flows, from the getting started guide
- Documentation overview page
- Documented examples
- Show **switch to manual** button if the device-list request failed.
- Added `deviceName` to the ouput of the climate-sensor. Resolves #75
- Added `separateOuputs` option the the climate sensor. Resolves #75
